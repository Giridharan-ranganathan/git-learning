1 - Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
  HTTP/1.1 
    * HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) .
    * It works on the textual format.
    * There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
    * It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
    * It compresses data by itself.
  HTTP/2
    *It works on the binary protocol.
    *It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
    *It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
    *It uses HPACK for data compression.


2 - Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
OBJECT:
  * Objects are collections of key-value pairs.
  * They can hold various data types and even other objects.
  * Example: 
     Obj = {
         name: "Sparrow",
         age: 80, 
         email: "n@example.com" 
     }

Internal Representation of Objects:
   * Hash Tables --Efficient data structure for storing key-value pairs.
Facilitates fast retrieval and insertion of values based on keys.
   * Hidden Classes and Inline Caching: 
Optimization techniques used by JavaScript engines.
